                <dd class="experiance__dd">In my early experience to the field of software engineering, I was frustrated by what I encountered.  I was expecting to dive into high level programming but I was stuck at the part where I can only work on small apps by myself, but I definitely can’t work on bigger apps in the right way. I felt like my goal to become a software architect was threatened. But later on, I was able to understand that every thing starts from and a scratch and that’s what makes this field interesting . Although I wasn’t able to build a program from scratch at the beginning , I started to enjoy finishing programs that has been started by others and also doing other simple staffs . Then gradually things start shaping up.</dd>
                <dt class="experiance__dt">Major Experience</dt>
                <dd class="experiance__dd">After those heavy times , I started to see and do what I really imagined my self of doing .  I was able to produce big apps from the scratch , I was able to become a team leader of big project designing groups and teams. We started developing popular websites , build interesting programs and famous video games . I got the chance of working in well known national and international agencies which help me reach the level I am now at . I gained experiences which I haven’t had when I was a fresh university graduate . My view of the field and problems changed dramatically . I realized seeing software engineering as pure coding was wrong and there was more to it than simple coding . it was a discipline that makes human life so comfortable and address issues which we often count as simple problems which in reality are big setbacks that hinder societies strive for development . </dd>
