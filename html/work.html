        <p class="work__text">Both alone and  collaboration with others , I have made some programs that gained popularity among a huge mass of public users . The game Analyzer was our first product released in 2015. With an in-turn cash of 2 million dollars it was one of the most successful programs I have ever made . In 2016 in collaboration with my friends we designed  “hello-Student” program which focused on student teacher management system . In the same year I have designed the “mesh” video game on android devices .</p>
